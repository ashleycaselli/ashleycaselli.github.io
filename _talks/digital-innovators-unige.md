Since a while the Swiss federal government has shown an increased interest in underground space and its management. The underground space is getting more and more attention because it has been identified as a valuable resource for future cities development. However, such process demands for clear and detailed underground information which are still difficult to collect.
In those cases where data are available, linking GIS and BIM information has been a very promising solution to integrate construction projects into the broader vision of territorial or urban planning. This approach would allow to optimise the placement, design, and construction of buildings as well as detect potential spatial conflicts.

The goal of this seminar is to present SUBSURFACE, an ontology used to represent 3D underground objects. One of its main characteristics is the integrative nature, given by the interconnections that it has with several ontologies (CityGML, IFC, WKT geometry), that enables the exploitation of geospatial data coming from different sources.

The SUBSURFACE ontology also allows to represent completion (heuristics) and compliance (regulations) rules in city models. Thanks to that feature, processes such as automated data completion using inference and regulations compliance checking may be carried out. We will show a preliminary demo that exploits a rule engine to complete geospatial RDF data and perform a regulation compliance checking on them. Finally, a 3D data visualization demo will be also shown.

This work is part of the Innosuisse SUBSURFACE project (2018-2020). Partners: hepia, Unige, Topomat, Canton Geneva, SIG.
