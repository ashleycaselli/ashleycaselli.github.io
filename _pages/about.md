ðŸ‘‹ I am Ashley, a PhD Student and Teaching Assistant at the Computer Science Centre (CUI, for Centre Universitaire d'Informatique), a subdivision of the University of Geneva.

My research interests focus on knowledge graphs and semantic web tools. In particular, I am working on a generalized and cross-domain framework for automated regulatory compliance using semantic knowledge graphs and SHACL.

Also, I am
- maintainer of the [TopBraid SHACL API](https://github.com/topquadrant/shacl) open-source implementation
- main developer of [SHACL eXtended (SHACL-X)](https://shacl-x.github.io/docs/)
